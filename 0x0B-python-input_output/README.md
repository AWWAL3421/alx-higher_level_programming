Exceptions: Exceptions are events that occur during the execution of a program that disrupt the normal flow of instructions. They're used to handle errors and other exceptional conditions.
Exception Groups: Exception Groups are a way to collect multiple exceptions together. This is useful in situations where multiple errors occur simultaneously, such as in concurrency frameworks, and you want to handle them collectively.
Try Function: The try function, specifically the try...except block, is used to catch exceptions. It allows you to specify code that might raise an exception, and then handle that exception gracefully without crashing the program.
Raise Function: The raise function is used to deliberately create and raise an exception. It's used when you want to signal that something unexpected or erroneous has happened in your code.
Add Note: Some exception objects have a method called add_note(note) that allows you to attach additional information (notes) to the exception after it has been caught. This can be useful for providing more context or details about the error.
